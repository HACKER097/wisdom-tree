Edit Quotes Script
------------------

This script reads an input file (qts.txt) containing quotes and writes an output file (edited_quotes.txt)
with corrected punctuation spacing. The Scanner class processes each character in the file, applying specific
rules for whitespace and punctuation to improve formatting.

Usage:
    python edit_quotes.py

Notes:
    - Ensure that 'edited_quotes.txt' is empty before running the script.
    - The script is designed to fix common issues such as extra spacing or missing spaces after punctuation.
