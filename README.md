# Usage

Use `left` and `right` arrow keys to change music

To add your own music, place it inside the `res/` directory (all music must be in `.ogg` format)

Use `up` an `down` arrow keys an `enter` to select and start Pomodoro timers.

While using lofi-radio use `n` to skip song and `r` to replay

`[` and `]` to increase and decrease the music/ambience volume respectively

`{` and `}` to increase and decrease the sound effect volume respectively

*You can replace arrow keys with vim's navigation keys (hjkl)*

`m` to mute music.

`r` to toggle repeat.

`u` to toggle q[u]iet mode, which mutes growth sounds and timer start sounds.

`space` to pause and unpause.

`+`, `-` to seek 10 sec forwards and backwords

number keys `0-9` to go 0-90% into the audio. Eg; pressing 6 will take you 60% into the audio, 7 will take you 70% and so on.

To exit press `q`

## Custom quotes

The user can use any set of quotes by adding a file called `qts.txt` with
one qoute per line to the defualt config location:

{`CONFIG_LOCATION`}/wisdom-tree

where {`CONFIG_LOCATION`} is the default place to save configuration files
for the operating system:

- windows: The folder pointed to by `LOCALAPPDATA` or `APPDATA`
- mac/linux: The folder pointed to by `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config`

*for now, adding a custom quotes file disables the default quotes*

# Tipping 

Before you consider donating, please note that I am still a school student and code in my free time, donating **will not** help me work on wisdom-tree or my other projects faster. Your tip can end up on onlycoins at worst, or pay for my college tuition at best.
